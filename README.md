# Luminous-proof-of-concept
Proof of concept for the Luminous algorithm's interpreter and renderer

### Idea

Learning is the process which every software engineer should be familiar with. Unfortunately there are a lot of difficulties that prevent from effective learning. There is a common principle which declares that complexity depends on the number of components of a problem you don't know. It's like an equation with multiple variables, existence of each variable increases the complexity of the solution. It could be applied to many areas of people's activity. So the key point in this is next: reduce number of unknown to reduce complexity.

### Goal

**To reduce complexity of the learning algrorithms.**

The way of solving this problem is in presentation of the ideas that lay inside algorithms.
The one of the to achieve that is to show what algorithm actually does (instead of how it's actually implemented).

***The main goal is to build a visualiser for algorithm.***
